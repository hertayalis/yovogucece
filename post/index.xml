If you wish to maintain the plant more tidier, you may cut away some of the oldest branches in the spring, or you can trim the plant to shape after it has finished blooming. After blooming, prune the stems back by approximately one-third to make the plants more bushy. Pruning should not be done after mid-summer.</description></item><item><title>How R.E.M.

This loaf is another soft one – extremely fluffy, with plenty of air bubbles and a little chewiness to it, like the others. The sourdough flavour, on the other hand, is still pretty mild. Wheat flour, water, salt, yeast, and malted barley flour are the main ingredients.

多くのアゲ嬢がカリスマの名声を挙げましたが、
その中でも、時代が長く続いてる方といえば、
「愛沢えみり」さんです。
現在、夜の世界で働く人間であれば、
男性（ホスト）であっても知らない人はいないでしょう。
キャバ嬢としてだけでなく、
実業家としても成功してる愛沢えみりさんですが、
その交友関係は芸能界にまで及びます。
先日、自身のインスタグラムの中で、
歌手で実業家のGACKTを登場させて話題となりました。
果たしてGACKTさんと愛沢えみりさんは、
どのような交友があるのでしょうか？
愛沢えみりのインスタにGACKTが登場した理由 愛沢えみりさんのインスタにGACKTさんが登場すると、
フォローしてるファンは歓喜、
「美男美女だ」とコメントで溢れかえりました。
投稿のコメントを見てると、
GACKTさんのポーカー番組に出演したことが、
このツーショットが誕生した理由になったようです。
愛沢えみりさんをブッキングしようというセンスが、
いかにもGACKTさんらしい、斜め上をいく発想ですね！
普段からGACKTさんと愛沢えみりさんに交友があるかは不明ですが、
互いに実業家としての一面を持っているので、何かしらのパーティなどで顔は合わせてそうですね・・・。
GACKTさんといえば、過去に週刊誌に、
キャバ嬢関連のガセネタを書かれた苦い過去がありますが、
その世界（キャバクラ）のトップの方（愛沢えみり）は、
その報道を気にしてない様子です。
楽屋にキャバ嬢を連れ込んでなんちゃらとか、
自宅にキャバ嬢を監禁してなんちゃらとかいう記事ですが、
あの記事を覚えている人はいるのでしょうか？
いや、本当に信じてる人はいるのでしょうか？？笑
愛沢えみりさんも、過去に安倍総理とのツーショットを、
Snowアプリを使用して撮影してアップしたことで、
物議を醸しましたが、今回のGACKTさんにもブレずにSnowを使用してます。。笑
キャバ嬢との共演がタブー視しないGACKTさんと、
相変わらずSnowアプリで大物とツーショットが撮れる彼女と、
互いに周りの声を気にしない、メンタルモンスターな印象を受けました。
二人とも美しいというのを超えて、
かっこいいですね！
愛沢えみりのプロフィール 愛沢えみりさんの経歴に関しては、
現役キャバ嬢とは思えないほどオープンに公表されています。
やはり、モデルやタレントとしての活動も兼ねてるので、
その部分で、ある程度はホワイトなしとく必要があるのでしょうか？
生い立ちなどをハッキリ公表しながらも、
現役でナンバーワンを維持してるところが、
愛沢えみりさんの、今までのカリスマと違った部分です。
